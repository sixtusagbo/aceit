# Inspiration
Most exam questions tend to follow a similar structure to past questions, and some teachers even repeat questions. However, after exams, students often discard their question papers, only to scramble for them when exams approach again.

I recall a moment during my 200-level studies when I overheard a group of students discussing how the structure of their current exam questions matched past questions. They mentioned the usefulness of apps for past JAMB or WAEC questions and wished for a mobile app that could provide easy access to past questions across various subjects.

Realizing this need, I saw an opportunity to create a solution. When the time came to choose a project for my ALX specializations phase, I decided to build a product that would make accessing past questions easier for students. This app aims to help students prepare effectively, ensuring they have the resources they need to succeed.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the **Ace iT** app on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- ### Requirements

  Ensure you have the following installed:

  - [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
  - [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (included with Flutter)
  - An IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - After setting up a new project on [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), download and add valid **Google Services** configuration file for Firebase integration:
    - **Android**: `google-services.json`
    - **iOS**: `GoogleService-Info.plist`

  * Install Flutter dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

  * Set up the environment variables:

    - Copy over the [.env.example file](lib/.env.example) to a new file called development.env (or your preferred name).
    - Update the env variables with the appropriate values from Firebase console.
  
  * Run the code generator:

    To build:
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build -d
    ```
    Run in watch mode if you'll be making more changes:
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch -d
    ```
  
  * Run the app

    Make sure you have an emulator running or a physical device connected, then:
    - On CLI: `flutter run`
    - On VSCode: `Ctrl + F5`
    - On Android Studio: ``
